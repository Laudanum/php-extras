# PHP Extras

Collection of helper PHP classes. These are used by [docker-php-apache](https://github.com/panubo/docker-php-apache). These are fairly specific at the moment but we hope to make then more generic in the future. We welcome contributions.

## Usage Example

Set the following environment variable:

`phpopts_auto_prepend_file=SSLHelper_prepend.php`
